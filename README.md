# Mobile Application Development Semester Project
As part of a semester project in the lecture Mobile Application Development at Technische Hochschule Lübeck in 2018, every student had to build a small todo app with Android. Jump to the [project requirements](#requirements-to-pass-the-lecture), to get a feeling for what had to be done in the project. Please note that all aspects regarding the UI were left to the students.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
In order for the app to be tested, the following prerequisites must be created/installed beforehand:
* Android Studio
* An Android virtual device to start the apk
* The AVD must have at least one fictual contact

### Installing
* Clone this Android project and open it in Android Studio.
* Build the project with Gradle and start the app with your AVD.

## Requirements to pass the lecture

### Data model
The data model for Todos should allow to represent the following information:
- [x] The name of the Todo
- [x] A description of the todo
- [x] Information about whether the todo was done or not
- [x] Information about whether it is a particularly important /'favourite' todo or not
- [x] The due date of the todo and a time
- [x] All information components, including the name, should be changeable after creating a todo

### Saving todos
Todos should be saved using both an external web application and a local data store. The Web application is provided as a Java EE Web Application.
- [x] Todos are to be stored in an SQLite database on the mobile device

### Login
The registration should be done by entering an email and a password and by pressing a login button.
- [x] Only email addresses should be entered in the input field for email.
- [x] If no email address is entered, a permanently visible error message is displayed.
- [x] If the entry of the email field is changed, the error message disappears immediately when a character is entered/deleted.
- [x] Passwords should be numeric and exactly 6 digits long.
- [x] The input should be hidden.
- [x] It should only be possible to use the login button if values for email and password have been entered.
- [x] After pressing the login button, the entered values are to be transmitted to a server and checked there.
- [x] The check should be asynchronous.
- [x] As long as the check is running, a Progress dialog is to be displayed.
- [x] If the check fails, a permanently visible error message is output.
- [x] If one of the two fields is changed, the error message disappears immediately when a character is entered/deleted.
- [x] If the entered values are checked successfully, the todos should be displayed.
- [x] If there is no connection to the web application when starting the Android application, the todo list is displayed immediately. A local login is not required. (Note: points for this requirement will only be awarded if the registration using the web application has been implemented in principle.

### Todo list
The todo list should display an overview of all todos and enable the creation of new todos. It should display the following information for each todo:
- [x] the name
- [x] the due
- [x] the information if it is done
- [x] the information if it is a favorite
- [x] It should also allow the user to view the details of each Todo.
- [x] Changes to the todo list that can be made in the detailed view of a todo should be displayed in the overview on return.
- [x] It should be possible to modify the information on completion/non-completion or importance without requesting the detailed display.
- [x] Todos should always be sorted by Completed/Not Complete and then either by importance+date or by date+importance.
- [x] The user should be able to select the display by date+importance vs. importance+date via an options menu or action bar options.
- [x] Overdue todos - i.e. todos with an expired due date - should be highlighted visually.

### Detail view
The detail view should show all data represented by a todo. Sie soll außerdem die Änderung zumindest der folgenden
Daten eines Todo ermöglichen:
- [x] the name
- [x] the description
- [x] the due
- [x] the information if it is done
- [x] The UI controls provided by Android for this purpose are to be used for setting the date and time.
- [x] The deletion of a todo should also be possible via the detailed view and should be confirmed before execution.

### Link with contacts
Allow the association of a todo with a set of contacts at the data model level.
- [x] Allow the user to optionally link todos to a list of contacts at the level of the detail view.
- [x] The contacts are to be selected on the basis of a display of all available contacts.
- [x] View the linked contacts in the detail view for Todos.
- [x] Allow you to remove contacts from a todo's linked contacts list.
- [x] Also allow the user to be contacted by e-mail or SMS for each contact if an e-mail address or mobile phone number is available.
- [x] When contacting, the email address/mobile phone number, the title and the description of the todo of the Android app used in each case should be transmitted.

## Built with
* Android
* Gradle
* SQLite
